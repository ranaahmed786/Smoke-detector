## What is a smoke detector?

A smoke detector is a safety device designed to alert you when it detects smoke, often indicating a fire. It typically consists of a sensor that can sense smoke particles in the air. When smoke is detected, the device emits a loud alarm to warn you of potential danger. Smoke detectors are usually installed on ceilings or high on walls, as smoke rises. They are powered by batteries or connected to the building's electrical system. Regular maintenance, such as changing batteries and testing the alarm, is important to ensure the smoke detector functions properly in an emergency.

## PROJECT MOTIVE & OBJECTIVE:
The main objective of this project is to implement the basic knowledge of technical lab knowledge to a real life solution. We aim to make a smoke sensor which is an integral part of modern electronic world and plays a pivotal role in public safety and security.

## Apparatus:
Following apparatus is used in the successful completion of this project
1.	MQ2-smoke sensor
2.	A bulb
3.	A buzzer 
4.	Connecting wires
5.	Bread board
6.	DC 5V rechargeable battery
## Procedure :
Following is the procedure for making a smoke sensor 
1.	Place the breadboard on a firm surface ensure that the breadboard is fully functional and does not have defected linkages.
2.	Then connect the GND point of the smoke sensor and negative terminal of the battery in on the breadboard with the help of connecting wires by ensuring that they are placed above above/underneath of each other on breadboard symmetry.
3.	Then connect positive terminal of the battery,the VCC point on the smoke sensor, the positive terminal of buzzer and a bulb wire using connecting wires on the breadboard by ensuring that they lie above/underneath of each other on breadboard symmetry. 
4.	Connect the DO point with the negative terminal of the buzzer along the other the other wire of the bulb on the breadboard by ensuring that they lie above/underneath of each other on breadboard symmetry .
5.	After securing all the connection we will go through all of the connections again to ensure that all the connections are according to their original configuration.
## Troubleshooting:
While making a lot of connections the chances of errors are quite high so if any of the component doesn’t work troubleshoot the circuit to check the fault this could include various ways and techniques involving in breaking the circuit and checking which connections or component is faulty.
## Testing :
After going through all the given instructions above ,we will then test the circuit by exposing it to smoke . If the doubt led turns on and the buzzer rings this means that we have successfully completed the task and the smoke detector is fully functional.
## Working principle:
The smoke detector operates based on the following sequence of events:
1.	Detection: The MQ-2 sensor continuously monitors the air for smoke particles. It outputs an analog voltage with the increases in the concentration of detected smoke.
2.	Signal Processing: The analog output from the MQ-2 is fed into a comparator circuit or microcontroller that processes the signal. If the analog voltage exceeds a predetermined threshold, it indicates the presence of smoke. This predetermined threshold can be calibrated using the circular knob at the back of the MQ2 sensor 
3.	Activation of Alerts:
•	Buzzer: When smoke is detected (i.e., the threshold is crossed), the circuit activates the buzzer, producing a loud sound.
•	LED: Simultaneously, the LED is turned on, providing a visual alert.

## Analysis :
After the critical analysis of the project and multiple testing following are the things that play an important role in the functionality of the smoke detector:
1.	Calibration: The MQ-2 sensor needs to be calibrated to set an appropriate threshold for smoke detection. This involves exposing the sensor to known smoke concentrations and adjusting the threshold accordingly.
2.	Power Supply: Ensuring a stable 5V DC supply is crucial for reliable operation. Voltage fluctuations can affect the sensor's accuracy.
3.	False Alarms: The MQ-2 sensor is sensitive to various gases. Proper placement and calibration are necessary to minimize false alarms from other sources like cooking gases.
4.	Maintenance: Regular maintenance and testing of the smoke detector ensure continued reliability. The sensor should be periodically tested with a smoke source to verify its functionality.

## Conclusion :
A simple smoke detector using an MQ-2 gas sensor, buzzer, LED, and 5V DC supply is an effective and economical solution for smoke detection. By understanding the role of each component and ensuring proper calibration and maintenance, this setup can provide reliable smoke detection and alerting capabilities, enhancing safety in residential or small commercial settings
